# Project-Challenge

This is a project I made as part of an interview process. I haven’t received a reply from the company, so I want to post this project (I actually like it… just a little).

You can see the requirements in the CHALLENGE.md file. I won't reveal the company's name, and since I didn’t sign anything, I guess I can share it.

For the solution to this challenge, I have used the Java Spring Boot framework, along with a PostgreSQL database. For the frontend, I have used Next.js 14

To streamline the development of this challenge, I have used an open-source Spring Boot boilerplate. Additionally, for the Next.js 14 project, I started the project directly using TailwindCSS and the NextUI library for styling.

At the end of the README, you will find the respective credits and links for each of these projects.
